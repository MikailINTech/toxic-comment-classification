# NLP Project : Toxic Comment Classification

## Introduction

In this project, I reviewed two methods to classify toxic comments in a dataset: 
 - Bag of word model, a first simple model to experiment basic concepts.
 - BERT model, using state-of-the-art model to get best possible performance.

The goal was to learn about these concepts and also to see if state-of-the-art model is not overkill for such a task.

## To test the code

The two methods are separated into two folders. In each folder, the preprocessing part and training part are done in two different notebooks. 
The data is provided in the /data folder.
